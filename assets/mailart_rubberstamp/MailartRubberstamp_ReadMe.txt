Mailart Rubberstamp now has an additional Bold weight and Obliques. The typeface has also been updated with subtle outline improvements, a bigger repertoire of European accented characters, and more consistent, slightly tighter spacing; increase the tracking to recreate the more relaxed, rustic appearance of the earlier version. The fonts are derived from the individually rubber-stamped letters on printed and collaged envelopes received from mailartists, and the typeface Clarendon Condensed.
